## Credential Storage Options

Mercia's Quill allows you to choose where your seaofthieves.com [credentials](/sea-of-thieves-api/auth) stored, on the client-side where Mercia's Quill will never access them, or on the <Tooltip tip="default">server-side</Tooltip>.

<Card title="Server-Side Storage" icon="server">
  If you choose to allow Mercia's Quill to store your credentials on the server-side, the browser extension will periodically access your cookies from [seaofthieves.com](https://seaofthieves.com) and pass them along to store in Mercia's Quill's database. This allows enabling [fetching
  cycles](#fetch-cycles) which happen in the background.

  <Warning> 
    It cannot be expressed enough that these secure cookies are like passwords. Regardless of the <Tooltip tip="IP-restricted database and asymmetric encryption of cookies at rest">security measures</Tooltip> taken, there is still a potential risk.
  </Warning>
</Card>

<br />

<Card title="Client-Side Storage" icon="desktop">
  If you configure Mercia's Quill to store your credentials on the client-side,
  the browser extension will periodically access your cookies from
  [seaofthieves.com](https://seaofthieves.com) and copy them as cookies in
  [merciasquill.com](https://merciasquill.com) - never leaving your browser.

  <Note>
    This will disable background data refreshing by Mercia's Quill, but is a significantly more secure method of storing your credentials.
  </Note>
</Card>

## Fetch Cycles

Fetch cycles happen in the background when opting into server-side storage and periodically update your sea of thieves data. You are allowed the options of refreshing every 12, 24, 48, or 72 hours, or <Tooltip tip="set to 0">never</Tooltip>. If you want to graph your data without manually refreshing, this is the ideal method with server-side credential storage.
